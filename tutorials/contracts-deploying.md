title: "Tutorials | Deploying your Smart Contracts to a Chain - Eris v0.11"

---

# Introduction

For this tutorial, we are going to use a very simple `get` and `set` contract. All this contract does is get and sets a value.

**Note** -- This tutorial is built for Eris versions `>= 0.11.1`. For other versions of this tutorial please see below:

* [v0.11.0](/tutorials/deprecated/contractsdeploying-v0.11.0/)

## Dependencies

Welcome! This tutorial assumes that you have a chain ready to deploy smart contracts to. Should you not have any idea what smart contracts are, please see our [explainer here](/explainers/smart_contracts). If you do not have a chain ready to work on, please see our [chain making tutorial](/tutorials/chain-making).

## Contracts Strategy

We are going to use a very simple `get` / `set` contract which sets a variable and gets that same variable. It is about the easiest interactive contract one can imagine and as such we will use that for showing how to work with the eris platform.

## Overview of Tutorial

In general we are going to take two steps in order to get our contracts deployed to the blockchain:

1. Make sure your application package has the proper information
2. Deploy the contracts

# Make A Contract for Idi

The first thing we're going to do is to add a very simple contract.

```bash
cd ~/.eris/apps
mkdir idi
cd idi
```

Now you'll make a file in this directory. Let's assume that is called `idi.sol` and has the following contents

```javascript
contract IdisContractsFTW {
  uint storedData;

  function set(uint x) {
    storedData = x;
  }

  function get() constant returns (uint retVal) {
    return storedData;
  }
}
```

What does this contract do? Well, it isn't very interesting, we know. It merely `gets` and `sets` a value which is an unsigned integer type. **Protip:** Get the file with `curl -X GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eris-ltd/coding/master/contracts/idi/idi.sol -o idi.sol` rather than copy pasting.

# Fixup your epm.yaml

Next we need to make an `epm.yaml` and make it look something like this:

```yaml
jobs:

- name: setStorageBase
  job:
    set:
      val: 5

- name: deployStorageK
  job:
    deploy:
      contract: idi.sol
      wait: true

- name: setStorage
  job:
    call:
      destination: $deployStorageK
      data: set $setStorageBase
      wait: true

- name: queryStorage
  job:
    query-contract:
      destination: $deployStorageK
      data: get

- name: assertStorage
  job:
    assert:
      key: $queryStorage
      relation: eq
      val: $setStorageBase
```

**Protip:** Get the file with `curl -X GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eris-ltd/coding/master/contracts/idi/epm.yaml -o epm.yaml`

Now, what does this file mean? Well, this file is the manager file for how to deploy and test your smart contracts. `eris:package_manager` will read this file and perform a sequence of `jobs` with the various parameters supplied for the job type. It will perform these in the order they are built into the yaml file. So let's go through them one by one and explain what each of these jobs are doing. For more on using various jobs [please see the jobs specification](/documentation/eris-pm/latest/jobs_specification/).

### Job 1: Set Job

The `set` job simply sets a variable. `eris:package_manager` includes a very naive key value store which can be used for pretty much anything.

### Job 2: Deploy Job

This job will compile and deploy the `idi.sol` contract using Eris' compiler service (or run your own locally). The job will wait for the deploy transaction to confirm before it will proceed.

### Job 3: Call Job

This job will send a call to the contract. `eris:package_manager` will automagically utilize the abi's produced during the compilation process and allow users to formulate contract calls using the very simple notation of `functionName` `params`. `eris:package_manager` also allows for variable expansion.

So what this job is doing is this. The job is pulling the value of the `$setStorageBase` job (`eris:package_manager` knows this because it resolved `$` + `jobName` to the result of the `setStorageBase` job) and replacing that with the value, which is `5`. Then it will send that `5` value to the `set` function of the contract which is at the `destination` that is the result of the `deployStorageK` job; in other words the result of Job 3. For more on variables in `eris:package_manager`, please see the [variables specification](/documentation/eris-pm/latest/variable_specification/).

Finally, it is waiting on the call to be sunk into a block before it will proceed.

### Job 4: Query Contract Job

This job is going to send what are alternatively called `simulated calls` or just `queries` to an accessor function of a contract. In other words, these are `read` transactions. Generally the `query-contract` is married to an accessor function (such as `get` in the `idi.sol` contract). Usually accessor, or read only functions, in a solidity contracts are denoted as a `constant` function which means that any call sent to the contract will not update the state of the contract.

The value returned from a `query-contract` job then is usually paired with an assert.

### Job 5: Assert Job

In order to know that things have deployed or gone through correctly, you need to be able to assert relations. `eris:package_manager` provides you with:

* equality
* non-equality
* greater than or equals (for integers & unsigned integers values only)
* greater than (for integers & unsigned integers values only)
* less than or equals (for integers & unsigned integers values only)
* less than (for integers & unsigned integers values only)

Relations can use either `eq` `ne` `ge` `gt` `le` `lt` syntax, or, in the alternative they can use `==` `!=` `>=` `>` `<=` `<` syntax in the relation field. This is similar to Bash. To make this more explicit we have chosen in the above `epm.yaml` to use the `eq` syntax, but feel free to replace with `==` syntax if you want.

Both the `key` and the `val` (which in other testing frameworks are the `given` and `expect`ed in an assert function) use variable expansion to compare the result of what was supposed to be sent to the `setStorageBase` job (which should have been sent to and stored in the contracts' storage) with what was received from the `queryStorage` job (which in turn called the `get` function of the contract).

# Deploy (and Test) The Contract

See the [chain making tutorial](/tutorials/chain-making) if you need to review the chain making process. This series of commands assumed you followed that tutorial and continued here after `eris chains stop simplechain`.

First, let's get our chain turned back on.

```bash
eris chains ls
```

If it's on, you'll see:

```
CHAIN        ON     CONTAINER ID     DATA CONTAINER
simplechain  *      efeeb0dd63       d06301b3a5
```

Whereas if it has been stopped, the `ON` field will have `-` rather than `*`. The same logic applies to services.

If simplechain is not running, then turn it on with:

```bash
eris chains start simplechain
```

or create a new chain if simplechain no longer exists.

Now, we are ready to deploy this world changing contract. Make sure you are in the `~/.eris/apps/idi` folder, or wherever you saved your `epm.yaml`. Note that this is a very common pattern in simple contract testing and development; namely to (1) deploy a contract; (2) send it some transactions (or `call`s); (3) query some results from the contract (or `query-contract`s); and (4) assert a result. As you get moving with contract development you will likely find yourself doing this a lot.

```bash
addr=$(cat $chain_dir/addresses.csv | grep simplechain_full_000 | cut -d ',' -f 1)
echo $addr
```

That will make sure we have available the address we would like to use to deploy the contracts. Now we're ready. If the above does not output an address then check your $chain_dir variable and also check that the `simplechain_full_000` variable exists in the addresses.csv.

```bash
eris pkgs do --chain simplechain --address $addr
```

You *should* be able to use any of the addresses you generated during the chainmaking tutorial since they all have the same permission levels on the chain (which, if you followed the simple tutorial are basically all public). If you are using this tutorial outside of the tutorial sequence then you can just give it the address that you'd like to use to sign transactions instead of the `grep simplechain_full_000` bash expansion.

(For those that do not know what is happening in that bash line: `cat` is used to "print the file" and "pipe" it into the second command; `grep` is a finder tool which will find the line which has the right name we want to use; the `cut` says split the line at the `,` and give me the first field).

Note that `eris:package_manager` can override the account which is used in any single job and/or, `eris:package_manager` can set a default `account` job which will establish a default account within the yaml. We find setting the default account within the yaml to usually be counter-productive because others will not be able to easily use your yaml unless they have the same keys in their `eris-keys` (which we **never** recommend). For more on using accounts [please see the jobs specification](/documentation/eris-pm/latest/jobs_specification/).

That's it! Your contract is all ready to go. You should see the output in `epm.json` which will have the transaction hash of the transactions as well as the address of the deployed `idi.sol` contract.

**Troubleshooting**

If you get an error which looks something like this:

```irc
Performing action. This can sometimes take a wee while
Post http://chain:46657/status: dial tcp 172.17.0.3:46657: getsockopt: connection refused
Container eris_interactive_eris_service_idi_tmp_deploy_1 exited with status 1
```

That means that your chain is not started. Please start the chain and give the chain a second to reboot before rerunning the deploy command again.

<hr />

If you get an error which looks something like this:

```irc
open /home/eris/.eris/keys/data/1040E6521541DAB4E7EE57F21226DD17CE9F0FB7/1040E6521541DAB4E7EE57F21226DD17CE9F0FB7: no such file or directory
Container 74a9dbf3d72a2f67e2280bc792e30c7b37fa57e3d04aeb348222f72448bdc84a exited with status 1
```

What is this telling us? Well, it is telling us that it doesn't have the key in the `keys` container. So what you'll want to do is to update with one of the keys you have generated during the prior tutorials.

To see what keys are currently on your key signing daemon do this:

```
eris keys ls
```

If you do not have any keys then please take the time to [make some keys](/tutorials/tool-specific/keyexporting). After you find a key which you currently have, then add that as the `address` flag to the `eris pkgs do` command.

<hr />

If you choose the wrong key then you'll get an error which will probably look something like this:

```irc
Error deploying contract idi.sol: unknown account 03E3FAC131CC111D78B569CEC45FA42CE5DA8AD8
Container edbae127e1a31f1f85fbe14359362f7943028e57dc5eec4d91a71df706f5240f exited with status 1
```

This means that the account `03E3FAC131CC111D78B569CEC45FA42CE5DA8AD8` has not been registered in the `genesis.json`. The account which is not registered will be the same account you told epm to use via the signing server (`eris-keys`).

To "see" your `genesis.json` then do this:

```
eris chains cat simplechain genesis
```

You can also see your `genesis.json` at `http://localhost:46657/genesis`. Note: replace `localhost` with the output of `docker-machine ip eris` if on OSX or Windows. See our [docker-machine tutorial](/tutorials/tool-specific/docker_machine/) for more information.

<hr />

If the account you are trying to use has not been registered in the `genesis.json` (or, latterly, has not been given the appropriate [permissions](/documentation/eris-db-permissions/) via permission transactions) and been given the appropriate permissions, then it will not be able to perform the actions it needs to in order to deploy and test the contract. The easiest thing to do at this point is to [update your genesis.json](/tutorials/tool-specific/genesisupdating/).

Once you have the following sorted:

1. The provided account parameter matches a key which is known to the signing daemon; and
2. The provided account parameter matches an account in the `genesis.json` of a chain;

Then you'll be ready to:

```bash
eris pkgs do --chain simplechain --address ADDR
```

Where `ADDR` in the above command is the address you want to use.

<hr />

If you have an error which complains about how a container cannot be removed which looks something like this:

```irc
Error removing intermediate container 1f3a1d541241:
Driver btrfs failed to remove root filesystem
1f3a1d541241e757d48f34329508253e9ee139380b7b914a3b1104677eb0e8ee:
Failed to destroy btrfs snapshot: operation not permitted
```

Then rerun the `pkgs do` command with the `--rm` flag at the end, which will stop the containers from trying to be removed as part of the tear down sequence.

<hr />

If you have an error complaining about not being able to reach the compiler service, like this:

```irc
failed to send HTTP request Post https://compilers.eris.industries:10114/compile: dial tcp: i/o timeout
Error compiling contracts
Post https://compilers.eris.industries:10114/compile: dial tcp: i/o timeout
```

Then that means one of the following:

* You're working offline, e.g. on the train, or
* You're behind a corporate firewall/proxy and can't access the compiler URL.

To fix this, you can either go online, or download and run the _compilers_ service locally by doing the following - you need to be online for this, though:

```bash
eris services start compilers
```

When you run this for the first time, it will download the _compilers_ Docker image, and then start the service.

Once the service is running, you can deploy packages by adding the address of your compiler service to the command line parameters. Replace the IP address with your local IP address, depending on your OS. If you're on Windows or Mac OS X, you will have to use the Docker-Machine VM's IP address (`192.168.99.100` by default):

```bash
eris pkgs do --chain simplechain --address $addr --compiler 192.168.99.100:9091
```

When you're done with your work, you can stop the _compilers_ service like the other eris services:

```bash
eris services stop compilers
```

**End Troubleshooting**

Since we have a deployed contract on a running chain, please do take a look at the available options for eris contracts with:

```bash
eris pkgs do -h
```

That's it! :-)
