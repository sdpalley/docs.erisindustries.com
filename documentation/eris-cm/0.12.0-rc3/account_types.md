# Default eris chains Account Types

In order to reduce the complexity of dealing with permissioning
of chains, eris chains uses the concept of account_types. Account Types are
simple default bundles of permissions, tokens, and names which are used
as an abstraction when building eris chains so as to reduce the complexity
of that process.

This document contains the default account types which are used by
eris chains make when creating the necessary files for a new chain. Users
have an ability to add additional account_types which will be needed for
their purposes in a very easy manner.

The defaults provided by eris:chain_manager should be thought of as simply
that, defaults, rather than as restrictive ("we only get these") manner.
